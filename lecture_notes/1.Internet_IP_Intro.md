## 1.1 A Day in the Life of an Application

### Byte Stream Model

- **World Wide Web (HTTP Protocol)**
  - Interaction between Client A and Server A.
  
- **BitTorrent**: A peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that facilitates decentralized distribution of data and electronic files over the Internet.
  - Involves Client A, B, ..., and Server A.
  - Concepts: Pieces, Swarms.
  
- **Skype**
  - Communication between two clients.

## 1.2 The Four-Layer Internet Model

### Application Layer
- Initiating requests, e.g., sending a GET URL.
- Establishing a bi-directional, reliable byte stream between two applications using application-specific semantics (e.g., HTTP, BitTorrent).

### Transport Layer (Reliable Data Delivery)
- Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- Ensures correct, in-order delivery of data end-to-end.
- Manages congestion control.

### Network Layer (Unreliable Data Delivery)
- Responsible for end-to-end packet delivery.
- Components: Network Packet (Datagram), IP (Internet Protocol).
  - IP datagrams can get lost, necessitating the Transport Layer.
- Operates on best-effort delivery principles.

### Link Layer
- Facilitates data transmission over a single link between end hosts and routers, or between routers.

_*Note 1: IP is considered the "thin waist" of the model._

_*Note 2: The 7-layer OSI Model has been largely replaced by this 4-layer model._
