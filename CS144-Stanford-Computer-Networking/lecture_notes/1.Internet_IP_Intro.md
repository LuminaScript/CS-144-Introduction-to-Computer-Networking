## 1.1 A Day in the Life of an Application

### Byte Stream Model

- **World Wide Web (HTTP Protocol)**
  - Interaction between Client A and Server A.
  
- **BitTorrent**: A peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that facilitates decentralized distribution of data and electronic files over the Internet.
  - Involves Client A, B, ..., and Server A.
  - Concepts: Pieces, Swarms.
  
- **Skype**
  - Communication between two clients.

## 1.2 The Four-Layer Internet Model

### Application Layer
- Initiating requests, e.g., sending a GET URL.
- Establishing a bi-directional, reliable byte stream between two applications using application-specific semantics (e.g., HTTP, BitTorrent).

### Transport Layer (Reliable Data Delivery)
- Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- Ensures correct, in-order delivery of data end-to-end.
- Manages congestion control.

### Network Layer (Unreliable Data Delivery)
- Responsible for end-to-end packet delivery.
- Components: Network Packet (Datagram), IP (Internet Protocol).
  - IP datagrams can get lost, necessitating the Transport Layer.
- Operates on best-effort delivery principles.
- - [More about the Network Layer](#network-layer)

### Link Layer
- Facilitates data transmission over a single link between end hosts and routers, or between routers.

_*Note 1: IP is considered the "thin waist" of the model._

_*Note 2: The 7-layer OSI Model has been largely replaced by this 4-layer model._

## 1.3 The Internet Protocol (IP) Service Model
**Properties**:
- Datagram: Individually routed packets. Hop-by-hop routing.
- Unreliable: Packets might be dropped
- Best Effort: Only drop datagram if necessary.
- Connectionless: No per-flow state. Packets might be mis-sequenced.
  
**Why so simple?**
- Simple & Minimal -> Faster
- The end-to-end principle: Implement featrues in the end host.
- Allows a variety of reliable/unreliable services to be built on top.
- Works over any link layer

**Details**:
- Tries to prevent packets looping forever: TTL Field
- Fragments packets if they are too long: more than 1500 bytes
- Uses a header checksum to reduce chances of delivering datagram to wrong destination
- Allows for new versions of IP:
    - Currently IPv4 with 32 bit addresses
    - And IPv6 with 128 bit addresses
- Allows for new options to be added to header

## 1.4 Life of a Packet
### TCP Byte Stream (3-way handshake)
```
Client              Server
   |   Synchronize   |
   |---------------->|
   |                 |
   | Synchronize &   |
   | Acknowledge     |
   |<----------------|
   |                 |
   |   Acknowledge   |
   |---------------->|
```
- Addresses:
  - network layer address: IP address
  - transport layer address: port
 
- Routers; can have many links
  - Inside Each hop -> Forwarding table

## 1.5 Packet Switching Principle
### Packet switching
- **Definition**: Independently for each arriving packet, pick its outgoing link. If the link is free, send it. Else hold the packet for later.
- **Consequences**:
  1. Simple packet forwarding
  2. Efficient sharing of links
    - **No per-flow state required** 
      - **Flow**: a collection of datagrams belonging to the same end-to-end communication (e.g. TCP connection)
      - No per-flow state to be added/removed
      - No per-flow state to be stored
      - No per-flow state to be changed upon failure
    - S**tatistical Multiplexing**
      - Packet switching(PS) allows flows to use all avilable link capacity
      - PS allows flows to share link capacity

## 1.6 Layering Principle

### Reasons for layerig:
- Modularity
- Well defined service
- Reuse
- Separation of concerns
- Continous improvement
- Peer-to-peer communications

## 1.7 Encapslation Principle
### Encapsulation (Layer N data is payload to layer N - 1):

## 1.8 Byte Order
- LSB and MSB
- Little endian: LSB is at lowest address
- Big Edian: MSB is at lowest address

## 1.9 IPv4 Addresses
### Goal of internet Protocol Addresses
- stitch many different networks together
- Need network-independent, unique address
### IPv4:
- an IPv4 address identifies a device on the internet (layer 3 network address)
- 32 bits long
- Netmask:
  - 255.255.255.0: if the first 24 bits match
  - 255.255.252.0: if th first 22 bits match

### Address Structure
- Orginally 3 classes of addresses: class A, B, and C.
- Current: Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR)

## 1.10 Longest Prefix Match (LPM)
### LPM: 
    Algorithm IP routers use to chose matching entry from forwarding table

## 1.11 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- **Physical Address (MAC Address)**: A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment.
- **Logical Address (IP Address)**: An address assigned to each device on a network, allowing them to be identified and communicated with on the network.
### Addressing Problem
- **Need for ARP**: In a typical IPv4 network, data is sent in frames that require a MAC address to reach the correct destination. However, network applications and protocols generally use IP addresses.
ARP's Role: ARP bridges this gap by mapping network layer addresses (IP addresses) to link layer addresses (MAC addresses).
- **Process**:
  - ARP Request: A device sends an ARP request packet within a network broadcast. This packet contains the sender's MAC and IP addresses, and the target's IP address.
  - ARP Reply: If a device on the network has the requested IP address, it responds with an ARP reply, providing its MAC address.
- **ARP Table**: Devices maintain an ARP cache or table, storing recently acquired IP-to-MAC address mappings to reduce network traffic.
